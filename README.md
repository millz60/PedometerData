Pedometer Graph Data for the last week

###About
This app uses Apple's HealthKit framework to access the device's pedometer data, and then generates a graph based on the user's daily
step count for the past week. Simply press the "Generate Personal Fitness Graph" button to view your walking stats for the last 7 days.
